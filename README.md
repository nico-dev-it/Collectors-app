# Collectors-app ✈️

This was a project during my time at iO Academy (2nd project). 

All cards can be viewed in the app. Details are coming from a database and displays on the page. PHP and CSS were used.

Each card represents a travel destination including, landmark, activity and food! 

You can also create your own card, simply add:
—> a name of country
—> a place
And any landmark, activity or food of your choice! 

Have some fun 🌍 😎
